			My working experience in working with the New Wave folks has been outstanding.
			The communication chain between their architect and consultants to the GC was exceptional.
			I look forward to working with their team in the future.

			As a small business owner, the biggest problem I have in the market place is people's sense of urgency.
			The team at New Wave are all over it, they have a sense of urgency and their follow up skills are terrific.
			I could not be more pleased with New Wave.
